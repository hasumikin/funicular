Funicular is a Rails plugin that enables you to write client-side UI components in Ruby, compiled to mruby bytecode (.mrb) for efficient browser execution.

## Features

- Write client-side code in Ruby instead of JavaScript
- Automatic compilation of Ruby files to mruby bytecode (.mrb)
- Development mode with debug symbols (-g option)
- Production mode with optimized bytecode (no debug symbols)
- Auto-recompilation in development when source files change
- Seamless Rails integration

## Prerequisites

Funicular requires the `picorbc` mruby compiler to be available in your PATH.

Installation instructions:
- Install picoruby: https://github.com/picoruby/picoruby
- Or add picorbc to your PATH

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "funicular"
```

Then execute:

```bash
bundle install
```

## Usage

### Directory Structure

Place your Funicular application files in the following structure:

```
app/funicular/
  models/              # UI models
    user.rb
    session.rb
  components/          # UI components
    login_component.rb
    chat_component.rb
  initializer.rb       # Application initialization (optional)
```

The `initializer.rb` file (or any file ending with `_initializer.rb`) is loaded last, after all models and components. Use it for application setup code like routing configuration.

### Compilation

#### Development Mode

In development mode, Funicular automatically recompiles your Ruby files when they change. The compiled bytecode includes debug symbols (-g option).

To manually compile:

```bash
bundle exec rake funicular:compile
```

Output:
- File: `app/assets/builds/application.mrb`
- Debug mode: enabled
- Size: ~19KB (with debug symbols)

The compiled file is placed in `app/assets/builds/` so that Rails asset pipeline (Propshaft) can process it and serve it from `public/assets/` with proper cache busting.

#### Production Mode

In production mode, compile without debug symbols for smaller file size:

```bash
RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake funicular:compile
```

Output:
- File: `app/assets/builds/application.mrb`
- Debug mode: disabled
- Size: ~16KB (optimized)

The compilation task is automatically run before `assets:precompile` in production deployments.

### Loading in Views

Include the compiled bytecode in your view using the `asset_path` helper. If you have an `initializer.rb` file, it will execute automatically when the mrb file loads:

```erb
<div id="app"></div>

<script type="application/x-mrb" src="<%= asset_path('application.mrb') %>"></script>
```

The `asset_path` helper ensures that:
- In development: The file is served from `app/assets/builds/` via Propshaft
- In production: The file is served from `public/assets/` with a digest hash for cache busting (e.g., `application-abc123.mrb`)

Example `app/funicular/initializer.rb`:

```ruby
puts "Funicular Chat App initializing..."

# Load all model schemas before starting the app
Funicular.load_schemas({ User => "user", Session => "session", Channel => "channel" }) do
  # Start the application after all schemas are loaded
  Funicular.start(container: 'app') do |router|
    router.add_route('/login', LoginComponent)
    router.add_route('/chat', ChatComponent)
    router.set_default('/login')
  end
end
```

### File Concatenation Order

Funicular concatenates files in the following order:

1. `app/funicular/models/**/*.rb` (alphabetically)
2. `app/funicular/components/**/*.rb` (alphabetically)
3. `app/funicular/initializer.rb` and `app/funicular/*_initializer.rb`

This ensures that:
- Model classes are defined before components that depend on them
- Components are defined before initialization code that uses them

## Rails Asset Pipeline Integration

Funicular integrates with Rails' asset pipeline (Propshaft) following Rails best practices:

### Directory Structure

```
app/
  funicular/                    # Source files (version controlled)
    models/
    components/
    initializer.rb
  assets/
    builds/                     # Compiled output (gitignored)
      application.mrb           # Generated by funicular:compile
      .keep                     # Keep directory in git
```

### Development vs Production

**Development:**
- Files in `app/assets/builds/` are served directly by Propshaft
- Middleware automatically recompiles when source files change
- Debug symbols included for better error messages

**Production:**
- `rake assets:precompile` runs `funicular:compile` first
- Propshaft copies files to `public/assets/` with digest hashes
- Example: `application.mrb` -> `application-abc123def456.mrb`
- Debug symbols excluded for smaller file size

### Cache Busting

Using `asset_path('application.mrb')` in views ensures:
- Correct path resolution in all environments
- Automatic cache busting when files change
- Standard Rails asset handling

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
